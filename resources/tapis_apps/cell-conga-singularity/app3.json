This iReceptor Analysis App uses Conga to perform T-cell repertoire analyses involving both gene expression and TCR receptors. The analysis will split the data by Repertoire and anlayse each repertoire individually.</p><p>Notes:<ul><li>Conga is designed for T-cell repertoires only. If a B-cell repetoire is downloaded the analysis will not analyze that repertoire.</li><li>Conga requires clonotype grouping of rearrangements to performs its analysis. Repertoires without clone data will be skipped and an error message printed.</li><li>Conga requires gene expression data to classify cells.</li></ul></p>",
