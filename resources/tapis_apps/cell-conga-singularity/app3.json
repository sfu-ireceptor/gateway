This iReceptor Analysis App uses Conga to perform T-cell repertoire analyses involving both gene expression and TCR receptors. The analysis will split the data by Repertoire and anlayse each repertoire individually.</p><p>Notes:<ul><li>Conga is designed for T-cell repertoires only. If a B-cell repetoire is downloaded the analysis will not analyze that repertoire.</ul></p>",
