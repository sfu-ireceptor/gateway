		<p>Dear valued iReceptor users,</p>

		<p>We need your help! As you know, iReceptor is a crucial data discovery platform that facilitates the curation, analysis and sharing of AIRR-seq data and related subject and sample metadata from multiple studies across many labs and institutions. Through our platform, we have enabled researchers to collaborate and accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies against autoimmune diseases, and cancer immunotherapies.</p>

		<p>However, we are currently facing a challenge with funding, which is why we need your input. We have created a survey to help us determine what services you would be willing to pay for to keep iReceptor running and to continue facilitating your research.</p>

		<p>By taking a few moments to complete this survey, you will have the opportunity to shape the future of iReceptor and help us secure the funding we need to continue providing the high-quality services you have come to rely on. Your feedback will enable us to develop sustainable business models and secure additional funding from potential investors and partners.
		</p>

		<p>We urge you to take the survey and share it with your colleagues and peers in the research community. Your input is invaluable, and we thank you in advance for your participation.
		</p>

		<p>Together, we can ensure that iReceptor continues to facilitate groundbreaking research and enable researchers to improve human health worldwide.</p>

		<p>Thank you for your support,<br>
		The iReceptor team</p>
